# Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project for detecting tomato plant diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model identifies different tomato diseases and provides confidence scores for predictions. Additionally, it includes a simple web interface that allows users to upload an image and receive predictions using FastAPI as the backend.


# Features
**Deep Learning Model**: Built with TensorFlow/Keras, trained on the PlantVillage Dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village).
**FastAPI Backend**: Accepts image uploads and serves predictions via an API.
**Web Interface**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based front-end for user-friendly interaction.

**Classes Predicted**:
Tomato Bacterial spot
Tomato Early blight
Tomato Late blight
Tomato Leaf Mold
Tomato Septoria leaf spot
Tomato Spider mites (Two-spotted spider mite)
Tomato Target Spot
Tomato YellowLeaf Curl Virus
Tomato Mosaic Virus
Tomato Healthy
